    "- For moderate data sizes, the simplest way is to download your data in a [format](../other_formats/export.ipynb) of your liking such as GeoParquet, GeoPackage, FlatGeobuf or similar.\n",
    "- For large datasets, see in the [FlatGeobuf section](../other_formats/export.ipynb) how you can stream a FlatGeobuf file from Databricks volumes into QGIS.\n",
    "- last but not least, check out this [plugin](https://github.com/danny-db/qgis-databricks-connector) to connect QGIS directly to a SQL warehouse and read Delta Lake tables with GEOMETRY columns.\n"
