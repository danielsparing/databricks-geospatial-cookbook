    "If you are processing geospatial data that's small enough to fit in memory, then besides (Databricks SQL and) [DuckDB Spatial](../duckdb-on-databricks/DuckDB_on_Databricks.ipynb), you can also consider using GeoPandas. For more scalable approaches, you could define Spark UDFs based on GeoPandas similar to how we defined them [on top of DuckDB Spatial](duckdb_udf.ipynb). As this guide is mostly focused on SQL-based approaches, we won't go into more detail here."
