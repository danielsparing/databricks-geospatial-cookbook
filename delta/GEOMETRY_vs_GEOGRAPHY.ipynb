    "- If in a Delta Lake table you only store (lat, lon) values, use [GEOGRAPHY](./GEOGRAPHY.ipynb) (with the caveat that for st_distanceshpere and st_distancespheroid to work, you would need to cast geographies to geometry as `geog::geometry(4326)`).\n",
    "- If you use an SRID other than 4326 or multiple SRID's, use [GEOMETRY](./GEOMETRY.ipynb). If you need to calculate values in meters from lat/lon, you can still cast to GEOGRAPHY as needed and use [measurement functions](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-st-geospatial-functions#measurements) like `st_area`, `st_length` or `st_perimeter`.\n",
    "- If you need compatility with other tools, you might consider [WKB](./WKB.ipynb) -- however, `spark.write.parquet()` would export GEOMETRY/GEOGRAPHY columns as WKB anyway.\n"
