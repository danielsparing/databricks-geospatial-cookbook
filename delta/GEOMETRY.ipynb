    "You can store geometry or geography data in a Delta Lake table in a [GEOMETRY](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/language-manual/data-types/geometry-type) column.\n",
    "\n",
    "_NOTE: As of 2025-08-03, the GEOMETRY and GEOGRAPHY types are not available yet in Serverless Compute and you need a DBR 17.1+ cluster to use this feature. This means that this is also not available in the Databricks Free Edition. This limitation is expected to be lifted in the very near future._"
